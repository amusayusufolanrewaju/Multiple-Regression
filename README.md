# Multiple-Regression
#### 📈 Multiple Linear Regression Project This repository showcases a project focused on Multiple Linear Regression, a fundamental technique in predictive analytics used to model the relationship between one target variable and two or more independent variables.
#### 🔍 Project Overview
- The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict a continuous outcome based on multiple input features. It includes:

#### Data cleaning and preprocessing

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Fitting and evaluating a multiple linear regression model

- Checking model assumptions (linearity, multicollinearity, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals)

- Interpreting regression coefficients

- Visualizing model performance

#### ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python

- pandas, NumPy

- scikit-learn

- statsmodels

- seaborn, matplotlib

#### 🎯 Outcome
- This project helps demonstrate how multiple regression can be used to uncover insights, test hypotheses, and make data-driven predictions in real-world scenarios.
